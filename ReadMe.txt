We provide the code (in txt.file) and data (in mat.file) to illustrate the EEIO analysis , simulated O3 and BTEX concentration and the cause-specific mortality rate analysis.

Case 1 was set up to study the impact of export-driven emissions on BTEX and O3 concentration.  In Case 1, NOx, NMVOCs, and CO emissions relevant to export demands were excluded.  By comparing the modelling results from base case and Case 1, the contribution of export-driven emissions on O3 and BTEX concentration can be revealed.  

Case 2 was set up to test the effectiveness of the cleaner production manners (in line with the proven and affordable technologies in EU) in the export capacities.  By comparing the sectoral emission intensities in China and EU, we estimated that an 1,165 kt of NMVOCs can be reduced from the export-relevant industrial capacities.  Given that NOx have been reduced aggressively and the persistent growth of NMVOCs from industries, we focused on the reduction of NMVOCs in this study and did not extend the discussion to the reductions of other precursors.  Therefore, an 1,165 kt of NMVOCs were excluded from the emissions inputs of Case 2, while the inputs of NOx and CO remained the same as that of base case.  Please note that the reductions of NMVOCs were done by sectors. In other words, sectoral specific reduction was made instead of an even reduction of all sectors.  By comparing the results of Case 2 and base case, we can estimate the effectiveness of the cleaner production manners in the export capacities.  

Case 3 was developed to understand the wider impact of cleaner production manners.  Case 2 assumed that cleaner production manners were only applied to export production lines.  However, it might not be true in reality.  If a shoe-making factory is decided to upgrade its technology and management, for example, it is more plausibly done for the whole production line rather than only for the shoes for export.  We estimated that the proposed manners in Case 2 would lead to a reduction of 4,437 kt of NMVOCs if they targeted the whole production capacities.  Therefore, Case 3 was set up by reducing the NMVOCs from industries by 4,437 kt, while the inputs of NOx and CO remained the same as that of base case.  Results of Case 3 were compared with base case to fathom the effectiveness of an industry-wide NMVOCs reduction effort.

O3 and BTEX were simulated in a validted air quality modeling platform coupling the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model, SparseMatrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model, and CMAQ model.
